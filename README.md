# Community Code of Conduct

**This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Last updated July 24, 2018.**

Everyone participating in the Square Play Club community — including any regularly scheduled or singleton events, Slack channel, or mailing lists — is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct.

Square Play Club is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Square Play Club organizers.

## Definitions

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other Square Play Club community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties

Square Play Club prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Square Play Club reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Square Play Club may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Square Play Club spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser.

## Reporting and Enforcement
If you are being harassed by a member of the Square Play Club community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately via email at [play@squareplay.club](mailto:play@squareplay.club).


### Slack

We are currently evaluating whether or not to create a Slack team for the Square Play Club.

If we do create a Slack team, reporting tools and guidelines will be added here.
